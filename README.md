### Further Notes

Prior to this final project, in the previous labs in the class RBE3001: Manipulation, we implemented, using MATLAB code, forward kinematics to calculate the robotâ€™s position in the task space given the joint variables, we implemented inverse kinematics and performed trajectory generation techniques in joint space and in task space to generate a smooth trajectory from one vertex to another and, as well, we implemented differential kinematics (a.k.a. velocity kinematics) for control of the robot.
In the final project, we will combine what we have learned to make a robotic pick and place sorting system. We will incorporate computer vision to identify targets, localize them with respect to the robot, move the robot towards the object, grab them, and sort them. Finally, it took us some experimentation to identify the best approach to achieve the final system which is explained in the report document.
